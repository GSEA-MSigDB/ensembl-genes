# Extract the human ensembl gene catalog to simple tables

This repository extracts a catalog of human genes from the Ensembl database.
It is ideal for situations where you want to represent human genes via stable Ensembl identifiers.
Data is extracted by a series of SQL queries as well as additional transformations in Python using Pandas.
Tables are exported to output branches based on the corresponding Ensembl version in TSV and Parquet format.

## Motivation

NCBI publishes the `Homo_sapiens.gene_info.gz` dataset of human genes with one row per gene.
It includes useful metadata like the gene symbol, synonyms, and chromosome.
However, we weren't able to find a comparable dataset for Ensembl genes (please [let us know](https://github.com/related-sciences/ensembl-genes) if this exists).
Therefore, we combined several SQL queries guided by Biostars answers —
for example to retrieve [symbols](https://www.biostars.org/p/14367/#480311), [alternative sequence allele groups](https://www.biostars.org/p/143956/#144112), and [chromosomes](https://www.biostars.org/p/106355/) —
and from [Open Targets pipelines](https://github.com/opentargets/platform-input-support/blob/b5bf58457ae71a7e32d0dae58340ff5f9d30591d/scripts/ensembl/create_genes_dictionary.py#L46-L78) to extract simplified tabular datasets.

## Development

```shell
# Install the environment
poetry install --no-root

# Update the lock file
poetry update

# Build the build to output (change 104 to desired release)
poetry run python src/ensembl_genes.py export --release=104

# Run tests
pytest

# Set up the git pre-commit hooks.
# `git commit` will now trigger automatic checks including linting.
pre-commit install

# Run all pre-commit checks (CI will also run this).
pre-commit run --all
```
